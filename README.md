# Error by Night

## Introduction

This is our submission for the MusalaSoft School Project.
Our program aims to model the relationships between students, teachers, teams and projects in a school. We have provided the option for multiple schools but each school is self-contained (i.e. one school's students cannot participate in another one's teams).

## Team

- SCRUM Master - Radoslav Stoychev, 10 B
- QA Engineer - Ivelin Bachvarov, 10 A
- Backend Developer - Emil Ribarev, 10 V
- Frontend Developer - Kiril Dimov, 10 A

## How to run

Currently we only support building the project under Windows using Visual Studio.

1. `git clone https://github.com/RAStoychev18/error-by-night.git`
1. Open the `error-by-night.sln` file
1. Use `F5` to initiate the build
1. If you wish to use our example backup file with 74 students and 20 teams where he have modeled the MusalaSoft Project, navigate to `ROOT/error-by-night/error-by-night` where `ROOT` is the repository root (the directory this file is in) and make a copy of `backup.example` renaming it to `backup` (no extension)
